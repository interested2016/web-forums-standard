This project aims to create an XML standard for web forums data as well as a suite of exporters and importers for common software to allow the transportation of data between installations.

The SVN trunk is currently considered completely unstable and in some cases there's not even finished code.  If you want to take a look at the most recent snapshot of code though, feel free.

The download section has some alpha versions of some of the code.  Feel free to download it, test it out, and give some feedback.
